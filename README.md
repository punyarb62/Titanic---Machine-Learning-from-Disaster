# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Overview

This project aims to predict survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information about passengers and their survival status. This repository contains code and resources for training and evaluating various machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.

## Project Structure

- `predict_result_for_submission` - Directory containing CSV files with prediction results.

- `titanic` - dataset files with the rawdata and cleaned data on data_cleaned_01.
- `project_walkthrough` - Jupyter notebooks for all data cleaning,preparation exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
- `README.md` - This file.
